A new Flutter project exploring into Google's Firebase as authentication and database. Haven found any good applications that helps beginning or professional traders record their trades in a fast and efficient manner. The discipline to keep track of trades helps you to grow as a trader and critical in understanding which part of your analysis went wrong.

Attempting to build a simple application that allow users to key in the, PRICE, ACTION, ANALYSIS (in the form of text or image), and fill in the outcome eventually. Looking to see if including Stop Loss / Take Profit might be essential
